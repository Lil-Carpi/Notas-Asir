# Comfort

==Confort== is an ==emotional state== of a person's mind, which, among other aspects, has a strong influence on behaviour, thinking, focus, attention, and the ability to concentrate. This is the feeling of well-being in the form of comfort and the attitude of risk-free behaviour. This is also ofthen referred to as the so-called ==comfort zone== in which the person ==thinks== he/she is located.

There is a so-called ==Yerkes-Dodson== law, which describes the cognitive performance as a function of the level of stress/nervousness. The performance curve for this is also very individual, as it depends strongly on emotional and motivational factors and is divided into four sections.

The most used presentation of this law and the performance process is the Hebbian version.

When it comes to comfort, it depends heavily on whether we have a healthy level of stress or have already crossed the threshold, leading to a reduction in our performance. It is very individual here where our center is. We are in an area that we are used to and that we consider comfortable. Mostly these are situations and fields in which we have already gained a certain amount of experience and know-how to find our way there.

When we leave the so-called ==comfort zone==, we enter a situation or field where we have litle or no experience. This kind of uncertainly lowers our ability to think and has a powerful impact on our thought process, which, in turn, slows us down.

The fact that small children do not exhibit such uncertainly is interesting.

==They love to try out something new all the time and are not afraid or uncertain of making mistakes.==

After all, ==mistakes are an essential part of the learning process==, and we should always keep it in mind.

An interesting question is that arises here is: "Why small children, unlike adults, do not feel such uncertainty?"

Let us firs look at the following diagram:

	Now imagine that you are standing at the entrance in front of a massive dark fores in the middle of the night. this forest is so dense that no daylight can get through the treetops. To the left and right of this forest, some cliffs are much too steep to climb down, and we know that somewhere in this forest, is the one thing we want to have.
	Will you go inside an look for it?
	Common sense would do anything not to.
	
	
	But what if the thing you want is a hundred meters further into the forest, and is brightly lit?
	That is the thing that will fulfill you the way we have always wanted it to.
	Would you risk it now?

Those who chose to leave the comfort zone would reach their destination faster than they thought they would. They would never have sprinted at such speed before in their lives.

Now we should understand the progression between decisions to step out of our comfort zone or stay in it. However, we will always learn something new, and it will become more comfortable each time.
