# Way of Thinking
[[Índice - CPTS|CPTS]]

	Imagine that you want to become a programmer, and you know that there are more than 200 different programming languages that can be used to create applications that can be cracked by debugging or reverse engineering. If we learned every programming language within 100 hours, we would spend 20,000 hours or 2,500 days (8 hours per day) or, in other words, almost seven years to learn all of these programming languages. As a result, we spend seven years learning all these languages and never tried to debug or reverse engineer the program we created. Great! Let us spend another seven years learning to debug an reverse engineering.

The field of information security is massive, making it impossible for anyone to learn everything. For example, if we wanted to learn over 200 programming languages in 100 hours each, it would take almost 7 years—without even practicing debugging or reverse engineering. Then, we would need another 7 years to learn those skills. This is clearly inefficient and unnecessary.

Each programming language has strengths and weaknesses, but mastering one makes it easier to learn others. All languages follow common principles defined by R. D. Tennent:

- **The Principle of Abstraction**
- **The Principle of Correspondence**
- **The Principle of Data Type Completeness**

In cybersecurity, we must quickly learn these principles and adapt to different environments. Often, we won’t understand how something works, and that’s when we need to investigate.

Learning-focused cybersecurity communities, such as Hack The Box, provide free resources, vulnerable machines, and guides. In these communities, there are two types of people:

1. Those who know nothing.
2. Those who think they know nothing.

This can be frustrating, but it’s part of the learning process. Respectful communication is key—everyone starts from zero. You can engage with the community through:

- **Forum**: [https://forum.hackthebox.com](https://forum.hackthebox.com)
- **Discord**: [https://discord.gg/hackthebox](https://discord.gg/hackthebox)

Many people don’t know their actual skill level. A penetration tester must understand many technologies, making specialization difficult. We can either learn about everything without mastering anything or specialize in a specific area.

Another approach is to develop an efficient learning methodology. Success depends on knowing how to search for information and learn quickly. But first, we must learn how to learn.

There are no shortcuts—practice is essential. Reading about programming helps understand code (passive learning), but writing and testing code (active learning) is necessary for improvement.

A common question is: **When is a penetration tester good enough?**  
Since no one knows everything, the key is to find, select, and adapt information effectively.

And one crucial concept is missing: **LEARNING**.

Learning how to learn is not easy. In school, we were taught only one way to solve problems without exploring alternatives. For example, try solving this equation:

**20 * ________ + ________ = 65535**

Now reflect: why did you solve it that way and not differently? Write it down and analyze your thought process.
